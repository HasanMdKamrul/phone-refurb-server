    "question": "How does prototypical inheritance work?",
    "answer": "Prototypical inheritance is a way of implementing inheritance in JavaScript. It is based on the concept of prototypes. In addition to the properties and methods that are defined on an object, each object has a prototype object. The prototype object has a prototype object of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain."
